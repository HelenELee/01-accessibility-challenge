# 01 Accessibility Challenge

## Description
This web page has been refactored to improve accessibility. This makes it work better with screen readers, video captions and braille keyboards, all of which help people with disabilities better use the web page. The improvements will also optimize the site for search engines.

I have completed this piece of work to aid my learning, specifically with regard to semantic HTML and concise and accurate CSS. The main issues I encountered in the original HTML/CSS was an overuse of DIV tags and no semantic HTML, no alt attributes for images, no title element and the CSS was duplicated where it could have been more concise and readable.
